# What this project does?
Design a web dashboard in MERN to communicate between two users: Manufacturer and
Transporter. Both will have different input forms for entering data

# Tech Stack
1.MongoDB for database 
2.nodejs & expressjs 
3.Reactjs and it's ContextAPI in frontend.  
4.Some important libraries used are jwt, crypto-js & material-ui.  

# More Details
Login and Registration Page: The user will have an option to choose either as
Manufacturer or Transporter during registration.

Landing Page (Separate for manufacturer and transporter): List out all the messages
received so far by showcasing order id which you can click and see the content. This
should have option to search depending on order_id, To and From

For Manufacturer:
The input form will have 4 input fields and one send push button:
1. Order ID: auto populate an Alphanumeric code (for ex: XB120)
2. To:
3. From:
4. Quantity: Drop down menu where he can choose 1,2,3 ton
5. Address: Auto populate this field from the address entering during registration
6. Transporter: Drop down menu to select transporter. Here we can choose only
single transporter.
If the manufacturer clicks the push button the message will go to the transporter

For Transporter:
Order ID: List box to select the order id received from the Manufacturer.
Price: input form, float value
Reply Button for sending messages back to Manufacturer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
